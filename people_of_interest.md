## 1) Ada Lovelace

Ada Lovelace was born in 1815 to the famous poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabelle Milbanke. She was later married to William King and was eventually referred to as "Ada Lovelace". Although her parentage and marriage made her famous, this is not what made her so well known. Ada is known today as the first person to design a computer program. Ada was very skilled in mathematics and she put her skills to use at the age of 17 with Professor Charles Babbage. Babbage showed Ada some machines he was working on and Ada was inspired by them. She set to work on her own projects and later published the first computer program. It is amazing to see that the first step toward the modern computer was made by two people in 1843.
