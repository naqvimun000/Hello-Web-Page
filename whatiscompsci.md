# What is Computer Science?

Computer science is where you study the functions and designs of the computer, learn its languages, and try to use them when programming. In computer science, you can learn how to hone your skills as a programmer. If you are new to computer science, then you can build your skills quickly after you learn the basics. I have a lot of fun in computer science and it also challenges my brain.
